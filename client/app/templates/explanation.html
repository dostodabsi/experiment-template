	</p> This is a so-called reaction time experiment, which means that
	you should answer as quickly as possible. The experiment consists of trials, which in turn
	consist of a short presentation of a picture, followed by a target.
	The target is either <em>congruent</em> or <em>incongruent</em>. Congruent means that 
	the letters are all the same. Incongruent means that the target letter is surrounded by
	different letters. Your goal is to press the key that corresponds to the target.
	In the example below, this would be <b>H</b> for the first two, and <b>S</b> for the second two.
	</p>

	<div class="target">
		<div class="wide">
			<p>HHHHHHH</p>
			<p>SSSHSSS</p>
		</div>
		<p>SSSSSSS</p>
		<p>HHHSHHH</p>
	</div>

	<p>
	If you have pressed the right key, you get a green <span class="right">O</span> as feedback.
	However, if you have pressed the wrong key or were too slow, a red <span class="wrong">X</span>
	will appear on the screen.
	</p>

	There will be a practice trial for you the get the general gist.
	To demonstrate your understanding, please click the heading <b>Explanation</b> above to proceed
